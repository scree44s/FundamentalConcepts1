Welcome to a WIP Concepts Project meant to help entry-level game developers learn some necessary nodes and structures needed to build most games!
This project is a Living-Document and will grow and change based on feedback given to me, as well as new, important features and items being implemented into new versions of UE!

To get started, I highly suggest getting the Github Desktop Application so you can easily clone this repository to your local computer. Here is a download link: https://desktop.github.com/download/
Once you have The repository Downloaded, you will also want to ensure that Unreal Engine is downloaded to your computer to access the project files. The current version of this project is: 5.5.1
Simply open the Fundamental Concepts 1 UE project file and you should be good to go!
