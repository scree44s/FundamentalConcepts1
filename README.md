Welcome to a WIP Concepts Project meant to help entry-level game developers learn some necessary nodes and structures needed to build most games!
This project is a Living-Document and will grow and change based on feedback given to me, as well as new, important features and items being implemented into new versions of UE!

To get started, I highly suggest getting the Github Desktop Application so you can easily clone this repository to your local computer. Here is a download link: https://desktop.github.com/download/
Once you have The repository Downloaded, you will also want to ensure that Unreal Engine is downloaded to your computer to access the project files. The current version of this project is: 5.6.1 (As of 10-10-25), you should have no issues opening this in 5.7!
Simply open the Fundamental Concepts 1 UE project file and you should be good to go!

Once the project is open, you can launch the preview to see an interactable UI that covers some topics with detailed guides. Otherwise, you can browse the different files in the project and read the detailed comments that cover how different nodes work!
